Hi, I’m Eythan.

I’m a platform engineering leader, a curious engineer, and, when time allows, a homelab enthusiast. In 2026, I decided to get more intentional about one skill I’ve consistently underinvested in: writing. This blog is my way of doing that.

## Why This Blog

There’s never a perfect time to start working on a goal, but there also hasn’t been a better time to publish and share ideas as an engineer. With tools like Hugo, GitHub Pages, and modern AI assistants, spinning up a simple static blog is easier than ever.

I’ve always considered myself an engineer at heart. I enjoy programming, stepping through unfamiliar codebases, and learning how systems fit together. Writing, on the other hand, has never come as naturally to me. This blog is a deliberate attempt to change that. It is a way to exercise a different part of my brain and get more comfortable expressing ideas clearly in writing.

That goal feels especially important in the current era of AI. Whether we like it or not, AI is not going away. Clear written communication, from prompts and design specs to reviews and architectural proposals, is becoming a key differentiator for effective engineers.

Early in my career, I learned that I could explain complex ideas verbally in a way that resonated with others, particularly when mentoring junior engineers. Translating that same clarity into writing has been harder. In an AI-augmented engineering world, writing is no longer optional. It is foundational.

I fully expect to use AI as part of this journey, but not as a replacement for my own voice. My goal is not to generate polished, generic posts with an LLM. Instead, I want a thoughtful partner. Something that can help critique structure, improve clarity, and challenge my thinking, while leaving the ideas and opinions squarely my own. I will likely write more about this creative partnership with AI in a future post.

At a high level, this blog is an attempt to bring more balance between the analytical and creative sides of how I think.

## What to Expect

It’s always hard to predict the future, especially in technology, but I expect this blog to span a few core areas over time.

- **Platform Engineering** - Topics like internal developer platforms, self-service infrastructure, golden paths, and platform adoption. What has worked for me, what hasn’t, and what I want to try next.

- **GitOps & Kubernetes** - My professional bread and butter. I spend a lot of time thinking about Kubernetes, GitOps workflows, and operating platforms at scale. I also run a Kubernetes cluster at home, which I use as a learning environment and playground.

- **Developer Experience** -  Long before “DevEx” became a buzzword, I cared deeply about making engineers’ lives easier. I’m interested in systems and workflows that reduce friction and let teams focus on meaningful work.

- **AI** - Not as a buzzword, but as a practical tool. I’m especially interested in the engineering side of AI enablement. Things like context engineering, tooling, and how these systems can augment what we’re already good at while supporting our weaker areas.

- **Personal Interests** -From time to time, I may write about reading, flight simulation, or other hobbies. I’m a husband and a dad to a five-year-old daughter and twin two-year-old boys, and creativity sometimes shows up in unexpected places.

This blog is a work in progress, much like the skills I’m trying to develop by writing it.

Thanks for reading. More soon.
