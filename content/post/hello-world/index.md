Welcome to my corner of the internet where I share notes on platform engineering, developer enablement, and building reliable systems at scale.

## Why This Blog

After years of building internal developer platforms, implementing GitOps workflows, and optimizing cloud infrastructure, I've accumulated a lot of practical knowledge that exists only in Slack messages, design docs, and my personal notes.

This blog is an experiment in **building in public** - sharing the patterns, trade-offs, and lessons learned from real platform engineering work.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Platform Engineering** - IDP patterns, self-service infrastructure, golden paths
- **GitOps & Kubernetes** - Multi-cluster management, progressive delivery, operator patterns
- **Developer Experience** - DX metrics, friction analysis, tooling adoption
- **Cloud Cost & FinOps** - Practical optimization strategies beyond "turn things off"
- **AI for Engineering Teams** - LLM-powered tools, documentation, incident analysis
- **Short Notes** - Quick observations and patterns worth documenting

## Format

Most posts will be **practical and concise** - closer to technical notes than long-form articles. I'm optimizing for:

- **Actionable patterns** over theoretical frameworks
- **Real trade-offs** over idealized architectures
- **Specific examples** over vague best practices

Think of it as a public Obsidian vault for platform engineering.

## Coming Soon

- **Cloud Cost Optimization** - The story behind $4.5M/year in savings
- **GitOps at Scale** - Patterns for managing 100+ clusters
- **Developer Portal Selection** - Backstage vs alternatives
- **AI Tooling for Platform Teams** - What actually works

Thanks for reading. More soon.
