## What I Do

I build platform engineering systems that accelerate software delivery and improve developer experience. My focus areas include:

- **Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)** - Self-service infrastructure and tooling
- **GitOps & Kubernetes** - Declarative infrastructure at scale
- **Developer Enablement** - Reducing friction in the software delivery lifecycle
- **Reliability Engineering** - SLOs, observability, and incident management

## How I Lead

I'm a player-coach engineering leader who believes in:

- **Practical systems thinking** - Solving root causes, not symptoms
- **Developer-first design** - Building tools developers actually want to use
- **Measurable outcomes** - DX metrics, deployment frequency, lead time
- **AI enablement** - Integrating AI tools into platform engineering workflows

## Proven Outcomes

- Led GitOps platform adoption enabling **+25% deployment frequency**
- Orchestrated GCP → AWS migration delivering **~$4.5M/year cloud cost savings**
- Championed AI adoption initiatives including enablement workshops and internal hackathons
- Built CI/CD pipelines supporting hundreds of microservices across multi-cluster Kubernetes environments

## What I'm Exploring

- AI-powered developer tools and platform engineering workflows
- Developer experience (DX) measurement frameworks
- Cost optimization strategies for cloud-native platforms
- Practical GitOps patterns for platform teams

## Personal-Professional

Outside of work, I maintain a homelab for experimenting with infrastructure patterns, use Obsidian for knowledge management, and write practical tech notes on this blog.
